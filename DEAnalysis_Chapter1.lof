\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Peripheral blood samples from 117 Indonesian males (plus 6 technical replicates) were collected by trained phlebotomists from the Eijkman Institute. My sample pipeline consisted of an initial quality control step using FastQC, trimmiming samples using the software Trimmomatic, aligning reads using STAR, and then counting the number of transcripts using featureCounts. I used a Limma+Voom differential expression pipeline that used TMM normalisation for between-sample normalisation, batch correction incorporating covariates known to affect expression levels into a statistical model, and then gene ontology testing using GoSeq and Camera.\relax }}{6}{figure.caption.3}
