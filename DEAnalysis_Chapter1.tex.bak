\begin{abstract}
Our understanding of function within the human genome has been largely limited to populations of European ancestry. In order to better characterise human functional diversity, this study aims to analyse regulatory variation in three isolated populations within the Indonesian archipelago. No study has yet analysed regulatory variation in Indonesia and the small, isolated nature of these populations makes them ideal to identify variants that have risen to higher frequencies. In this study, I identify variants influencing gene expression through the analysis of RNA sequencing data with a focus on pathways associated with immune function and disease.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{}
Humans, during their migration through diverse ecological settings, have experienced unique pathogenic and environmental pressures, consequently shaping genomes through microevolutionary processes. Although population genetic studies and genome-wide scans have provided new insight into the demographic and selection history of our species, the majority of variants found have been in non-coding regions of the genome {\cite{albert2015role, zappala2016non, pala2017population} making the biological processes they affect difficult to identify. In the past decade, the endeavour to understand genome biology and function has been greatly aided by gene expression studies in which regulatory variants can be matched to RNA expression data. This has facilitated our understanding of complex traits \cite{cookson2009mapping, albert2015role}, enabled us to identify variants associated with genetic disease \cite{kremer2017genetic}, and understand the relationship between genetic variation and immune phenotypic diversity \cite{gupta2014transcriptome,chen2016genetic}. To date, the vast majority of these studies have focused on populations of primarily European descent. Given the diverse demographic history of our species, this fails to capture the full landscape of human regulatory variation \cite{quach2016genetic, martin2017human}. This study will focus on identifying regulatory variation in small, traditional populations of Southeast Asia in order to better understand phenotypic diversity and traits associated with immune function and disease. 

\section{Study group}\label{}
Our study groups come from three small island populations within Indonesia: Mentawai, Mappi, and Sumba. The first two islands, Mentawai and Mappi, capture two major genetic ancestries within Indonesia—Austronesians (Mentawai) and Melanesians (Mappi)—and also provide possible source populations to the last island, Sumba. This island is host to a network of traditional communities that derive from pre-existing Melanesians, arriving on the island ~50,000 years ago, and incoming Asian farming cultures, arriving ~4,000 years ago \cite{cox2016small]. These populations reside in tropical climates and face similar pathogenic pressures from vector borne, water borne, and water contact diseases. The fact that they share similar environments yet have different genetic ancestries is a unique opportunity to understand gene environment interactions and the effect of ancestry-related variation and its effect on immune gene expression.

\section{Previous studies analysing regulatory variation outside of Europe}
Although previous gene expression studies have identified factors influencing population-level variation in gene regulation \cite{battle2014characterizing, westra2013systematic}, few have analysed them in non-European populations \cite{martin2014transcriptome, quach2016genetic}. One such study to analyse transcriptome variation across a globally distributed set of populations was performed by Martin et al. \cite{martin2014transcriptome}. In this analysis, genome, exome, and transcriptome sequencing data for seven global populations was generated from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 45 individuals in the Human Genome Diversity Panel (4-7 samples per population). The authors found that approximately 25\%\ of the variation in gene expression could be attributed to population differences and were able to identify novel gene structures. Although the small sample size of the study lacked the power to detect additional population-specific variants, it highlighted the role of demography in understanding functional genetic variation. Furthermore, this is one of the only studies to analyse RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on a Southeast Asian population. The other such study to do so to our knowledge, and the only study to analyse RNA-seq data from a population within Indonesia, was conducted by Yamagishi et al. \cite{yamagishi2014interactive}. This study analysed expression data collected from peripheral blood from 116 individuals infected with malaria. Despite having a population of over 260 million people, hosting hundreds of different ethnic groups, and covering the same area as continental Europe \cite{hudjashov2017complex}, no study has analysed expression data from healthy Indonesian samples.

Along with a lack of studies analysing variation outside of Europe, most studies use large cohorts of well-studied populations for transcriptomic analysis. This fails to account for the genomic variation in small, structured populations that experience different evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, small populations allow for the detection of rare variants that rise in frequency by chance, providing more statistical power for identification of functional alleles \cite{timpson2018genetic}. 

\section{Project significance and Aims}
Understanding how genes and regulatory networks operate is one of the biggest challenges in genomics and public health science. Not only do we have a limited understanding of the function of the human genome, but the regions we have characterised have been represented by only a small subset of all human genetic variation. Characterising this variation can ultimately lead to more accurate diagnosis and specific disease treatment, as well as a more thorough understanding of biological processes. Here, I analyses regulatory variation in 117 individuals who share similar environmental pressures yet have different ancestries in order to better understand how ancestry-related variation contributes to immune gene regulation.

\chapter{Methods}\label{}
\section{Sample collection and quality control}
A general overview of the differential expression pipeline is outlined in Figure \ref{fig:Study Pipeline}. Whole blood was collected by trained phlebotomists from the Eijkman Institute from over 300 Indonesian males. Samples were collected across multiple villages in the three islands using Tempus Blood RNA Tubes (Applied Biosystems) and extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. All extraction and sequencing batches were randomised with respect to village and island. RNA quality was assessed with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and concentration through Qubit (Life Technologies). On the basis of these results, we selected the five villages in our study for having the highest average RIN and the largest number of individuals with a RIN >= 6.5. Library prep was done by Macrogen (South Korea), using 750ng of RNA and the Globin-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina). 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{Figures/SamplePipeline.jpg}
\caption{Peripheral blood samples from 117 Indonesian males (plus 6 technical replicates) were collected by trained phlebotomists from the Eijkman Institute. My sample pipeline consisted of an initial quality control step using FastQC, trimmiming samples using the software Trimmomatic, aligning reads using STAR, and then counting the number of transcripts using featureCounts. I used a Limma+Voom differential expression pipeline that used TMM normalisation for between-sample normalisation, batch correction incorporating covariates known to affect expression levels into a statistical model, and then gene ontology testing using GoSeq and Camera.}
\label{fig:Study Pipeline}
\end{figure}

101-bp paired-end reads were generated by Illumina sequencing (HiSeq 25000). This resulted in a total of 117 individuals, including six technical replicates making a total of 123 sequences, sequenced in three batches (Supplementary Table \ref{table: Batch and replicate information}). This consisted of 48 individuals from the island of Mentawai (plus 1 replicate), 49 individuals from the island of Sumba (plus 4 replicates), and 20 individuals from the island of West Papua (plus one replicate). Upon data retrieval, all RNA sequencing reads went through an initial sample quality analysis using FastQC V0.11.5 (Babraham Institute, available for download at http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Base quality decreased near the 3’ end of reads, as is common with Illumina sequencing, and therefore all leading and trailing bases below a Phred quality score of 20 were removed using Trimmomatic version 0.36 \cite{bolger2014trimmomatic}.

\section{Alignment and transcript quantification}
RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human genome (GrCh38, Ensembl release 90: August 2017) with STAR version 2.5.3a \cite{dobin2013star}. I used a two-pass alignment to improve identification of novel splice junctions which resulted in a mean of ~29 million uniquely-mapped read pairs per sample (Figure \ref{fig:Total and percentage of reads at all filtering stages}, Supplementary Table \ref{table: nReads all stages}). Next, I performed read quantification with featureCounts version 1.5.3 \cite{liao2013featurecounts} and used a filtered GTF file for GRCh38.p10 that I created using the biomaRt R package. As some studies have suggested that prefiltering improves the performance of differential expression analysis by controlling the false discovery rate \cite{soneson2015differential}, I set filtering parameters to only include GENCODE basic annotation and transcript support levels 1-3 (i.e., transcripts with at least one non-suspect mRNA or expressed sequence tag). Since many transcripts are poorly supported, this method provides a way of including transcript annotations that are actually expressed in humans. I used the default settings for featureCounts paired end reads, where features of exons are grouped into meta-features of genes. On average, I successfully assigned ~15 million paired-end reads to each sample (Figure \ref{fig:Total and percentage of reads at all filtering stages}, Supplementary Table \ref{table: nReads all stages}).

\label{fig:Total and percentage of reads at all filtering stages}
\end{figure}

\section{Technical replicate analysis}
Six replicates were used in this study to ensure batch effects could be measured and removed: one sample was replicated twice in batches two and three (SMB-ANK-027) and the other four samples were replicated in batch three (MPI-381, MTW-TLL-013, SMB-ANK-016, SMB-WNG-021; Supplementary Table \ref{table: Batch and replicate information}). I compared all samples to their corresponding replicate by plotting the correlation between the log2-CPM normalised counts after removal of lowly-expressed genes and then fitting a best-fit regression line (Figure \ref{fig:Replicate Comparisons}). The correlation between samples after log2 transformation and removal of lowly-expressed genes ranged from an R-squared value of 0.97-0.99, suggesting high similarity between all replicates.

\label{fig:Replicate Comparisons}
\end{figure}

\section{Removal of lowly-expressed genes and data normalization}
To account for library size differences, I transformed expression counts to log2-counts per million using a prior count of 0.25 in order to avoid taking the log of zero. I then removed lowly expressed genes by only keeping genes expressed at or over a CPM of one in at least one of the island groups, resulting in a total of 12,975 genes (Figure \ref{fig:library density after removal of lowly-expressed genes}, Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:Total Genes Post Filtering}). After filtering, sample library sizes ranged from roughly 9 million to 23 million reads (Figure \ref{fig:library size}).

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{Figures/libraryDensity_afterFiltering_indoRNA.pdf}
\caption{Gene expression distributions before and after filtering for lowly-expressed genes. The density of log2 counts per million (CPM) are shown for each sample with pink lines indicating samples from batch 1, purple lines indicating samples from batch 2, and black lines indicating samples from batch 3. The left panel shows data from 27,413 genes and the right panel shows data from 12,975 genes after filtering (i.e., only keeping genes expressed at or over a CPM of one in at least one of the island groups).}
\label{fig:library density after removal of lowly-expressed genes}
\end{figure}

In order to eliminate composition bias between libraries, I tested three different normalization methods: upperquartile, trimmed mean of M values (TMM), and relative log expression (RLE). Visual inspection of all three methods showed similar performance of normalization (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:Testing Normalisation Methods}). A test of the TMM normalization was therefore chosen as it has been shown to have a low false discovery rate and high true positive rate \cite{pereira2018comparison}. Furthermore, it is also recommended for RNA-Seq data where over half of the genes are not believed to be differentially expressed \cite{chen2014edger}. In order to ensure composition bias was removed, I examined the performance of TMM-normalisation by plotting mean-difference (MD) plots for each sample. Most genes for each sample were centered around a log-fold change of zero, indicating that the composition bias was successfully removed (﻿Figure \ref{fig:TMM normalisation}).

\end{figure}

\section{Sample variation analysis and data exploration}
In order to identify outlier samples and assess which covariates might be associated with expression levels, I used principal component analysis on the TMM-transformed log2 expression values (for a full list of covariates, see Supplementary Table \ref{table: all Covariates}). Associations between covariates and expression levels were analysed by inspecting the first ten dimensions in the data for clustering within each group. To identify significant associations (p<0.05) between covariates and expression levels, I performed ANOVA tests between covariates and each dimension of the PCA. The first PCA was most strongly associated with batch (﻿Figure \ref{fig:PCA Batch}), followed by significant associations with island, sampling site, RIN score, CD8T cells, and granulocytes (﻿Figure \ref{fig:Significant Covariates}; for a full list of significant associations, see Supplementary Table \ref{table: PCA assoc}). Language, sampling date, sequencing pool, the Mappi tribe, and season also had significant associations, however these covariates were found to be confounded with other variables. In the second dimensions, blood cell type—in particular, granulocytes—had the highest correlation with expression levels. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

\label{fig:Significant Covariates}
\end{figure}

Hierarchical clustering by Euclidean on the TMM-normalised, log2-transformed samples was performed in order to identify any sample outliers and analyse sample grouping (﻿Figure \ref{fig:Euclidean Sample Distances}﻿). Samples were shown to mostly cluster by island and no clear outliers were identified. Furthermore, between and within-island variation was analysed using Pearson correlations between log2-CPM expression values of samples (﻿Figure \ref{fig:Island Variation}). As expected, most variation was seen between islands. Mappi was shown to have the highest amount of within-island variation and island populations compared to Mappi also had a higher degree of variation.

\end{figure}

\section{Differential expression analysis}
Because clear clustering was observed by batch, age, RIN score, and blood type (CD8T, CD4T, NK, B cells, monocytes, and granulocytes), I incorporated these known covariates into the design matrix of my linear model. The final model used to test for differential expression was therefore:

\textbf{\textit{~0 + Island + Age + batch + RIN + CD8T + CD4T + NK + Bcell + Mono + Gran}}

where island is the covariate of interest and Age, batch, RIN, and blood types are the covariates affecting expression levels. I then set up a list of contrasts comparing each island population, which consisted of the following contrasts: Sumba versus Mentawai, Sumba versus Mappi, and Mentawai versus Mappi. To test the number of differentially expressed genes at the village level, I replaced the covariate of interest with sampling site and set up my contrasts so that each village was contrasted with every other village. Furthermore, 16 samples from the Sumba population were removed which had 5 or fewer samples in each village. 
  
I removed high sample variability from the count data using Voom-normalisation on the TMM-normalised sample counts. Voom estimates the mean-variance relationship of log2 CPM-normalised counts and generates a precision weight for each sample \cite{law2014voom}. This approach enables poor-quality samples to be down-weighted and effectively eliminates the mean-variance relationship (﻿Figure \ref{fig:Voom normalisation}). Since technical replicates were used in the study design, the limma function duplicateCorrelation was used in order to estimate the correlation between expression measurements made on the same subject \cite{smyth2003limma}. DuplicateCorrelation takes information from replicated samples and uses an empirical Bayes method to moderate the standard deviation between genes \cite{smyth2003limma}. After running duplicateCorrelation on the samples, I then ran Voom a second time to incorporate the technical replicates as blocking variables and to feed in the estimated correlation within the blocks. A simple linear regression model was then fit to the voom output for each gene and an empirical Bayes moderated t-statistic was used to test each individual contrast from the design matrix equal to zero. When fitting the models, I used the ‘robust’ parameter in Limma’s ‘eBayes’ function in order to deal with outlier genes that have abnormally high or low variance. I then identified significant genes using an adjusted p-value of 0.01 (Benjamini–Hochberg corrected \cite{benjamini1995controlling}) and an absolute log-fold change of 1.

\caption{Mean-variance trend and elimination of the trend after applying Voom-normalisation to the TMM-normalised count data.}
\label{fig:Voom normalisation}
\end{figure}

\section{RUVs}
In addition to removing batch effects by regressing out known variables affecting gene expression, I also tested an alternative unsupervised batch-correction method using RUV \cite{gagnon2012using, risso2014normalization}. RUV uses factor analysis to control for technical effects based on control genes or samples. For this analysis, I chose RUVs which utilizes counts of negative control samples. Unlike RUVg which uses control genes to correct for technical effects, RUVs is less sensitive to the control genes used in the factor analysis \cite{risso2014normalization}. Because of this and the availability of technical replicates, RUVs was chosen as the RUV correction method. 
The first step of RUVs is to set up a count matrix using raw read counts. I did this using all raw reads filtered for lowly-expressed genes. I then performed upperquartile normalization on the dataset and checked the performance before and after correction (﻿Figure \ref{fig:UQ normalisation}﻿). 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{Figures/Normalisation_beforeandAfterUQnorm.pdf}
\caption{Sample variability of raw read counts before and after upperquartile normalisation. An RLE plot showing the total amount of variability in each batch (batch 1=pink,batch 2=purple, batch 3=black) can be seen before and after upperquartile normalisation (top and bottom left, respectively).

In order to perform RUVs on the raw read counts, RUVs needs four pieces of information: 1) the object containing read counts, 2) a list of control genes, 3) k, the model parameter indicating the number of hidden factors of variation, and 4) replicate information. For the object containing read counts, I used the upperquartile-normalised reads filtered for lowly-expressed genes. I then used all genes within the dataset for control genes, as this has been shown to perform well in an RUVs pipeline \cite{risso2014normalization}. For k, the number of hidden factors of variation, I tested values from one to six (the highest value of k is the total number of replicates in the study) and analysed the total amount of variation through RLE and PCA plots (﻿Figure \ref{fig:K Performance}﻿). A k of three to six was most effective in reducing the total amount of variation (﻿Figure \ref{fig:K Performance}, panels e, g, i, and k) and minimizing distances between technical replicates (﻿Figure \ref{fig:K Performance}, panels f, h, j, and l). In addition to looking at total variation, I also plotted the p-value distribution and total number of differentially expressed genes at an FDR of 0.01 and log fold change of 1 (﻿Figure \ref{fig:DE Genes K}). For each population comparison, I chose the best value of k as the inflection point in the total number of differentially expressed genes. This changed for each population comparison (Sumba vs Mentawai = 4, Sumba vs Mappi = 5, Mentawai vs Mappi = 3) and therefore chose a k of 5 based on its performance in the PCA and RLE plots.

\end{figure}

RUVs outputs estimated factors of unwanted variation and normalised counts, which are obtained by regressing out the original counts on the unwanted factors. After obtaining the factors of unwanted variation from RUV, I used the same negative binomial GLM approach, as done in the Limma pipeline, using known covariates. In my model, I included my covariate of interest as island and the estimated values of k from all 5 hidden factors of unwanted variation (for all estimated weights generated by RUVs, see Supplementary Table \ref{table: RUVs Weights}). I then converted my RUVs-corrected dataset to a DGE-list object, normalised the data with upperquartile normalisation, and applied Voom to eliminate the mean-variance trend (﻿Figure \ref{fig:Voom normalisation RUV}). As in the pipeline using known covariates (above), the duplicateCorrelation function was used was used in order to estimate the correlation between expression measurements made on the same subject, then Voom was run a second time to incorporate the technical replicates as blocking variables. The 'robust' parameter was used using Limma's eBayes function and all significant genes were identified using an adjusted p-value of 0.01 (Benjamini–Hochberg corrected \cite{benjamini1995controlling}) and an absolute log-fold change of 1.

\section{Comparing both}
After correcting for batch effects by regressing out known covariates influencing gene expression and with RUVs, I visually inspected grouping by batch through PCA analysis. The RUVs-corrected data had a higher percentage of variance in the first and second PCAs, whereas the limma-corrected data had less clustering by batch (﻿Figure \ref{fig:RUV vs Limma: PCA by Batch}). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) between each dimension of the PCA and known covariates showed a stronger association between batch and the RUVs-corrected data than the limma-corrected data (﻿Figure \ref{fig:RUV vs Limma: Heatmap of Covariates}﻿, Supplementary Table \ref{table: Limma-corrected PCA assoc}, Supplementary Table \ref{table: RUVs-corrected PCA assoc}).

Data corrected by the RUVs method shows more grouping by batch in PC1 and PC2, as well as a higher amount of variance}

\label{fig:RUV vs Limma: Heatmap of Covariates}
\end{figure}

In order to see which method had a higher amount of unexplained variation, I used the package variance Partition \cite{hoffman2016variancepartition} which uses a linear mixed model to partition the amount of variance attributable to each variable. The amount of variance explained by each predictor was higher in the linear modelling method, whereas the RUVs correction method had a higher amount of residual variance (﻿Figure \ref{fig:Variance Explained}).

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{Figures/VarianceExplained_LMvsRUVs.pdf}
\caption{Total amount of variance explained. variancePartition from the Bioconductor R package was used to assign the amount of variance from each variable in the data.

(B) The total amount of variance explained by each of the five weights calculated by RUVs, as well as island (the covariate of interest) and residual variance.}
\label{fig:Variance Explained}
\end{figure}

Since the batch correction method including known covariates influencing gene expression into a model had less residual variation and a lower association between expression levels and sequencing batch, this method was chosen to correct for batch effects. Furthermore, estimating batch effects through packages such as RUV may introduce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses, particularly when groups are not evenly distributed between the batches \cite{nygaard2016methods}.

\section{Gene enrichment analyses}
example: Gene enrichment analyses were performed using the topGO package in R, with a Fisher exact test. Differentially expressed genes between MTL-locals and SAG-locals were compared against the 15,632 genes expressed in the CARTaGENE cohort that were retained after QC filters (background). Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted with R the package reactomePA, and here again, the background set of genes was defined as the 15,632 genes expressed in blood that pass our filters (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 3).

\chapter{Results}\label{}

\section{Ancestry is associated with expression profiles}

After normalisation of the data and correcting for batch effects, expression profiles from each island formed unique clusters (Figure \ref{fig:Remove Batch Effect Island and Village}). PC1 and PC2 was most strongly correlated with island and village, as well as language and sampling date (two variables which were confounded with village). Mappi and season also had significant associations with PC1 (Figure \ref{fig:ANOVA Remove batch effect}).

I tested the number of differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.01) at differing log fold thresholds (0, 0.5, and 1; Table \ref{table:LogFC Thresholds}). The majority of differentially expressed genes had a log fold change below one, particularly in Sumba versus Mentawai (Figure \ref{fig:LogFC Density}). At all thresholds, comparisons between Sumba and Mappi had the highest number of DE genes (n = 4496 at 0 LFC, n = 1398 at 0.5 LFC, and n = 313 at 1 LFC), followed by comparisons between Mentawai and Mappi (n = 4088 at 0 LFC, n = 1017 at 0.5 LFC, and n = 227 at 1 LFC). Sumba versus Mentawai consistently had the least number of differentially expressed genes (n = 1545 at 0 LFC, n = 314 at 0.5 LFC, and n = 35 at 1 LFC). Populations compared to Mappi had the highest number of DE genes: at the most stringent LFC of one (FDR < 0.01), I found 135 DE genes. In comparison, populations compared to Sumba at the same significance threshold had 16 DE genes and populations compared to Mentawai had 10 DE genes (Figure \ref{fig:Venn Diagram between Islands}). This continued to hold true at differing LFC thresholds. A total of five DE genes were shared with all populations, most of which were involved in cell adhesion and cell growth.

When looking at the total number of differentially expressed genes at a finer scale, I found that many of the genes were driven by the Taillelou tribe (within Sumba) and Wunga tribe (within Mappi; Figure \ref{fig:UpsetR Village}). As expected, comparisons between villages had the least number of DE genes (Madobag and Tallelou within Mentawai: n = 471 at LFC 0; n = 53 at LFC of 0.5; n = 6 at LFC of l; Anakalung and Wunga within Sumba: n = 2 at LFC 0; n = 1 at LFC of 1; n = 1 at LFC of 1).

\section{Exploration of enriched gene sets in the Indonesian island populations}

In order to see what pathways were involved in the genes differentially expressed between island populations, I used the goseq package in R which accounts for gene length bias in 
detection of over-represented genes. I used the default Wallenius dustribution to approximate the true distribution and all 12,975 genes which passed the filtering threshold as the background. I first identified all differentially expressed genes at a log fold change threshold of one and a p-value of 0.01. Since very few enriched GO terms remained after this threshold, I changed the LFC threshold to 0.05, which resulted in 200 enriched GO terms for Mentawai versus Mappi and 31 enriched GO terms for Sumba versus Mappi. No enriched GO terms were found for Mentawia versus Sumba. In population comparisons to Mappi, many gene sets were enriched in processes involved in inflammatory response, cell to cell signalling, and the defense response (Figure \ref{fig:Revigo}). This was especially apparent in Mentawai versus Mappi, which had the highest number of enriched gene sets out of all population comparisons. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{Figures/RevigoPlots.pdf}

\label{fig:Revigo}
\end{figure}

In addition to enriched GO terms, I also looked at enriched pathways from c2 and KEGG databases using the EGSEA package in R. For c2 gene sets, many pathways were involved in interferon and immune activity, such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, regulation of IFNA signaling, and interferon gamma signaling \ref{fig:c2 Heatmap}. Interestingly, many c2 gene sets were also involved myeloid leukemia and other cancers. One of the highest enriched pathways was a c2 gene set associated with differences in mast cell production, of which the \textit{SIGLEC6} gene was most one of the most highly differentially expressed \ref{fig:Nakajima Mast Cell}. When searching the KEGG database, most significantly enriched pathways were involved in disease-associated phenotypes such as graft-versus-host disease, hepatitis C, viral myocarditis, glioma, and asthma.

\section{Many DE Genes are involved in the immune response} 

After exploring the pathways involved in enriched genes, I looked at specific genes that were highly differentiated between populations. A heatmap of some of the most highly differentiated genes can be viewed in Figure \ref{fig:Heatmap Top Genes}. As in the pathway analysis, many of the most highly expressed genes were involved in immune-related processes, such as \textit{SIGLEC6}, \textit{SIGLEC7}, and \textit{MARCO}. I analysed the distribution of all genes to see if significant genes were driven by individuals or uniform throughout the population. Samples from populations within each island generally had similar expression profiles for the most highly differentiated genes, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:top gene distributions}.

Since the majority of differentially expressed genes were in comparisons to the Mappi population, I plotted the log fold cnahge values of all genes in common with Mappi in order to see if there were similarities in the direction of regulation. I found that every single DE gene (LFC=1, pvalue=0.01) was either concordantly up or down regulated in Mentawai and Sumba \ref{fig:LogFC: Mappi vs Others}.

Two genes, SIGLEC6 and SOX5, had some of the highest adjusted pvalues in Mentawai verus Mappi and Sumba versus Mappi. Interestingly, SIGLEC6 was also found in to be involved in one of the most significant pathways involved in mast cell production.

Some interesting things: we have anlsyed how gene expressino looks in small populations in INdonesia. This has never been done in Indonesia, and aonly a handful of studies have analysed how populations differ in their trabscriptomic profile. Interstingly, we find that ancetrsy seems to correlate with differnces in genes expresion and that the populations with the two most disparate population histories have the highest number of differnetially expressed genes. We also find that the genes found to be most highly differentially expressed are primarily those involved in innate immune oathways. We annot tell whether this is due to biological differences, or whetheer this is caused by differences in regulatuoin due to encirinmental factors. These populations face significant environmetal pressures from pathogens. Many of which may be similar, but some can be different. Mappui in particular has a very different lifestyle- they live in treehouses and also have a lower amount of access to healthcare. This may affect their ability to repsond to infectoous diseases.
